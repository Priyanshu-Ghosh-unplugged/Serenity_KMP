**Serenity** is an open-source, privacy-first Android application that helps you find balance in your digital life. It detects cognitive overload from your phone usage and gently guides you into restorative "Sanctuary" sessions.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is built with Kotlin Multiplatform, aiming for a future where you can find Serenity on more than just your Android device.

## ✨ Core Philosophy

- **On-Device Intelligence**: All processing and decision-making happens directly on your device. Your data never leaves your phone.
- **Privacy First**: No invasive tracking, no ads, and no surveillance. Serenity is built on the principle that your wellbeing is your own business.
- **Gentle Guidance**: Instead of punitive blocking, Serenity offers gentle nudges and opportunities for you to take a break when you need it most.

## 🚀 Features

- **Cognitive Overload Detection**: Intelligently senses when you might be overwhelmed by your device usage.
- **Sanctuary Sessions**: Guides you into moments of restorative peace with calming visuals and sounds.
- **Offline-First**: Works entirely offline, ensuring your data and your peace are always protected.
- **Minimalist Design**: A clean, intuitive interface designed to reduce distraction.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

Serenity is built with a modern, scalable, and privacy-focused tech stack:

- **[Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-mobile-getting-started.html)**: Core logic is written in Kotlin and shared across platforms.
- **[Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/)**: The user interface is built with this modern declarative UI toolkit.
- **[Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room)**: For robust, on-device database storage.
- **[Dagger Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android)**: For dependency injection on the Android platform.
