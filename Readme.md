# Serenity KMP

**Your phone, finally on your side.**

Serenity is an open-source, privacy-first Android application that helps you find balance in your digital life. It detects cognitive overload from how you use your phone and gently guides you into moments of rest. Offline-first, on-device, and privacy-respecting.

## ✨ Features

*   **Cognitive Overload Detection**: Serenity's on-device AI detects patterns of cognitive overload based on your phone usage, without ever sending your data to the cloud.
*   **Restorative Sanctuary Sessions**: When the app detects decision fatigue, it gently guides you into restorative "Sanctuary" sessions to help you disconnect and recharge.
*   **Complete Privacy**: All your data and analysis stay on your device. No wearables, no tracking, no surveillance, no ads. Ever.
*   **Open-Source & Transparent**: Built with Kotlin, Serenity is fully open-source, allowing for complete transparency and community contributions.
*   **Ethically Built**: Designed to help you use your phone less, not more.
